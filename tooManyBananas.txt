After he goes to Doorduru, Sringeri finds something he did not expect!!!!!!!!!!
>>>>>>> secondEdition
There was a town-wide banana boycott going on. Nobody in the world wanted his bananas.
He burned down his stash, shaved his beard, and fled the country, taking on a new identity (Shail). He started a new life at the Pingry School. The government persisted to look for Sringeri, the man who denounced the banning of bananas, and tried to sell them. They searched far and wide to find this criminal, and they could not find him. They gave up and let Sringeri live on as Shail in the Pingry School, unless Jeremy found out Shailâ€™s identity. He promised to keep it a secret, so long as he constantly supplied jeremy with a steady number of bananas.  Secret Ending: Shail, low on bananas and close to become exposed, stabs Jeremy to death with a pin. I finished the second edition.
